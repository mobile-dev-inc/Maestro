        ### Thank you for using Maestro!


        We can't wait to hear your idea!


        First though, please search the [existing issues] to see if an issue
        already exists for the feature you need. Maybe someone already did the
        job for you and you don't need to fill this template.

        If you are sure that the feature you want to suggest hasn't been
        requested before, or if our documentation doesn't have an answer to what
        you're looking for, then fill out the template below. Please bear in
        mind that duplicates and unsufficiently described feature requests will
        be closed.
