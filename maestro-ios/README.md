# iOS Device Config

A wrapper around `simctl` and XCTest to communicate with iOS devices.

## Prerequisites

### Xcode

Install the latest Xcode (Command Line Tools are not enough, install the full IDE).

### IntelliJ setup

If you are working with this subproject, update your IntelliJ config (Help -> Edit Custom Properties) by including the following lines:

```
# Needed for working with idb.proto definition
idea.max.intellisense.filesize=4000
```

Then restart the IDE.
