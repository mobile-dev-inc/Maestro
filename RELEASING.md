2. Create a new branch
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md file with changes of this release.
4. Change the version in `gradle.properties` to a non-SNAPSHOT version.
5. Semantic versioning: a.b.c
   * a: major breaking changes

   * c: any other small changes
6. `git commit -am "Prepare for release X.Y.Z."` (where X.Y.Z is the new version)
7. Submit a PR with the changes against the main branch

After merging the PR, tag the release:

2. Update the `gradle.properties` to the next SNAPSHOT version.
