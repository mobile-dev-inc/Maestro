### Examples
Create a flow for any app on Android and iOS, with just a few lines of YAML.


<table>
<tr>
<th>Android</th>
<th>iOS</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
# flow_contacts_android.yaml

appId: com.android.contacts
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Create new contact"
- tapOn: "First Name"
- inputText: "John"
- tapOn: "Last Name"
- inputText: "Snow"
- tapOn: "Save"
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
# flow_contacts_ios.yaml

appId: com.apple.MobileAddressBook
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "John Appleseed"
- tapOn: "Edit"
- tapOn: "Add phone"
- inputText: "123123"
- tapOn: "Done"
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Quick Start

Get a CLI tool from homebrew

```
brew tap mobile-dev-inc/tap
brew install maestro
```

Write a simple test in a YAML file 

```yaml
# flow.yaml

appId: your.package.name
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Text on the screen"
```

Make sure an Android emulator is running. Check out the [docs](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro#android) for physical device support.

Run it!

```
maestro test flow.yaml
```


## iOS Support

Only iOS Simulators are supported at the moment.

For Maestro to work with iOS you would need to do few extra steps. 

Install [Facebook IDB](https://fbidb.io/) tool

```
brew tap facebook/fb
brew install idb-companion
```

And launch it:

```
idb_companion --udid {id of the iOS device}
```

## Why Maestro?

Maestro is built on learnings from its predecessors (Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, XCTest)

- Built-in tolerance to flakiness. UI elements will not always be where you expect them, screen tap will not always go through, etc. Maestro embraces the instability of mobile applications and devices and tries to counter it.
- Built-in tolerance to delays. No need to pepper your tests with `sleep()` calls. Maestro knows that it might take time to load the content (i.e. over the network) and automatically waits for it (but no longer than required).
- Blazingly fast iteration. Tests are interpreted, no need to compile anything. Maestro is able to continuously monitor your test files and rerun them as they change.
- Declarative yet powerful syntax. Define your tests in a `yaml` file.
- Simple setup. Maestro is a single binary that works anywhere.
