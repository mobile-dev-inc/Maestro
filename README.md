## Quick Start

Want to see Maestro in action? Run the sample flows included in the `samples` folder.  
In just a few minutes you can install the CLI, clone the repository and exercise a YAML flow against a sample app:

```bash
# install the CLI (macOS, Linux or WSL)
curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash

```

```

# clone the repository and run a sample flow
git clone https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro.git
cd maestro/samples
maestro test android-flow.yaml
```
This spins up the sample app on an emulator, interacts with the UI, and validates elements without manual coding.

## Why Maestro?

Maestro combines a human-readable YAML syntax with an interpreted execution engine.  
It lets you write, run, and scale cross-platform end-to-end tests for mobile and web with ease:

- **Cross-platform coverage** ‚Äì test Android, iOS, and web apps (React Native, Flutter, hybrid) on emulators, simulators, or real devices.  
- **Human-readable YAML flows** ‚Äì express interactions as commands like `launchApp`, `tapOn`, and `assertVisible`.  
- **Resilience & smart waiting** ‚Äì built-in flakiness tolerance and automatic waiting handle dynamic UIs without manual `sleep()` calls.  
- **Fast iteration & simple install** ‚Äì flows are interpreted (no compilation) and installation is a single script.

## Maestro Cloud ‚Äì Parallel Execution & Scalability

When your test suite grows, **Maestro Cloud** lets you run flows in parallel on dedicated infrastructure:

- **Run at scale** ‚Äì execute hundreds of tests in parallel and cut run times by up to 90%.  
- **Built-in notifications** ‚Äì send results to GitHub PRs, Slack, or email.  
- **Deterministic environments** ‚Äì stable infrastructure for reproducible tests.  
- **Debugging & device selection** ‚Äì includes video replay, logs, and device model selection.
