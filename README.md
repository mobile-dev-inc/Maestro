## Why Maestro?

Maestro is built on learnings from its predecessors (Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, XCTest, Selenium, Playwright) and allows you to easily define and test your Flows.

By combining a human-readable YAML syntax with an interpreted execution engine, it lets you write, run, and scale cross-platform end-to-end tests for mobile and web with ease.

- **Cross-platform coverage** ‚Äì test Android, iOS, and web apps (React Native, Flutter, hybrid) on emulators, simulators, or real devices.  
- **Human-readable YAML flows** ‚Äì express interactions as commands like `launchApp`, `tapOn`, and `assertVisible`.  
- **Resilience & smart waiting** ‚Äì built-in flakiness tolerance and automatic waiting handle dynamic UIs without manual `sleep()` calls.  
- **Fast iteration & simple install** ‚Äì flows are interpreted (no compilation) and installation is a single script.

**Simple Example:**
```
# flow_contacts_android.yaml

appId: com.android.contacts
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Create new contact"
- tapOn: "First Name"
- inputText: "John"
- tapOn: "Last Name"
- inputText: "Snow"
- tapOn: "Save"
```
